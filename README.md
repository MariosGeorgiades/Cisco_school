# 🌐 Cisco Networking & Cybersecurity Foundations

This repository contains my lab notes, configurations, and projects completed during my Cisco-certified school curriculum. This course was a turning point in my journey, as it moved me beyond abstract algorithms and into the world of **Networking and Cybersecurity.**

### ⚡ The Spark
While Competitive Programming taught me how to think, this curriculum taught me how the world connects. I discovered my true passion here: **architecting secure, resilient systems.** I realized that I don't just want to write software; I want to understand and protect the infrastructure it runs on.

### 🛠️ Technical Competencies
Through this Cisco-aligned curriculum (CCNA level), I gained hands-on experience in:
* **Routing & Switching:** Configuring VLANs, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), and Inter-VLAN routing.
* **IP Architecture:** Mastering IPv4/IPv6 subnetting and VLSM for efficient network design.
* **Network Security:** Implementing Access Control Lists (ACLs), DHCP snooping, and port security to harden network infrastructure.
* **Protocols:** Deep-diving into OSPF, EIGRP, and the TCP/IP stack.



### 📖 Course Content
* **Network Fundamentals:** OSI Model, Ethernet, and Cabling.
* **Switching Essentials:** Basic switch configuration and security.
* **Routing Logic:** Static and Dynamic routing configurations.
* **Wide Area Networks (WAN):** Understanding NAT, PAT, and remote connectivity.
